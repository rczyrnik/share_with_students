### My Notes (daily_notes_and_links.md)

During the program I kept my notes on a google site. In daily_notes_and_links.md you can find a brief explanation.

### Jupyter Workflow (czy_assessment_workflow_python.ipynb, czy_assessment_workflow_sql.ipynb)

Overtime I've developed what (to me) is a very efficient workflow for the assessments. czy_assessment_workflow_python.ipynb and czy_assessment_workflow_sql.ipynb have descriptions.

<em> NOTE! On the assessments, I will only grade code in the assessment.py (or equivilent). I will not go hunting through Jupyter notebooks for partial credit. </em>

### Closing Comments

I'm providing these files not because they represent the ONE TRUE WAY of doing things, or even because they represent a good way or doing things (they may not). It's your job as responsible adults to steal what may be useful and discard the rest.
